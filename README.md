# Kairos-Example-iOS-Swift

#

This is a simple demo for Kairos written in swift 4.1, in which a person sets the ID (the data they want to be returned when recognized) and Gallery name (kinda kairos folder in which they want to store).

Then put the Gallery name in which they have stored and press recognize to go to camera.

Supporting pods:

Alamofire - [https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

SwiftyJSON - [https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)


Just put your app\_id and app\_key in the ViewController.swift and CameraViewController.swift

```swift
var app_id = "";

var app_key = "";
```
